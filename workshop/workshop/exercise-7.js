// Q7
// Write a loop that will output every hour of the day (0 to 23) and
// determine whether it is time to sleep, eat or train.
// Life in the army is regimented! These are the hours alloted to each activity.
// Sleep between 22h and 5h
// Eat at 7h, 13h and 18h
// The rest of the time is spent training.

// The output should look something like
// It's 11h. Time to train!   ||
// It's 12h. Time to train!    
// It's 13h. Time to eat!

for (let hour=0; hour <23; hour++)
if ( hour = 7 || 13 || 18 ) {
    console.log("it's " + hour. + "time to eat!");

    console.log("it's " + hour. + "time to train!"); }
